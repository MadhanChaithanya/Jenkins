Jenkins Intro:
==============
- Jenkins is an Open-source automation server that is used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing and deliverying,
  or even deploying the software
- Automates the SDLC, so errors can be detected at a very early stage of the development.
- Entirely written in Java, so portable to all major platforms. Need Java 8+, Recommended Java 11
- Can run as a servlet inside Tomcat, Container or as Standalone application.

Jenkins History:
================
- Jenkins was originally developed under the name Hudson back in 2004 by the organization sun microsystems.
- Slowly Hudson started becoming populat with other companies and other people.
- When sun microsystems were brought over by oracle they kept the project but there were conflicts between the community supporting 
  hudson and oracle. so it was decided that the tool would be split into two; something oracle could call its
  own, hudson and Jenkins which was to be completely community driven project.
  
- Though both of them originally shared similar source trees, the tools are now quite different and 
  Jenkins has become more popular than ever now. it is now one of the most used CI/CD tools in the industry out there.
